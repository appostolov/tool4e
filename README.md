description:

    Hello! My name is Petar Apostolov, and I'm the creator of tool4e idea.

    The idea is to split web content( objects ) in to 3D view.
    User can fly around and look around, searching or not anything.

    The objects in this space react when the user is  close enough.
    User can interact with them via all possible UI available over the web.
    Every object is smart UI element, who can communicate with the user for ever,
    since it has resources to continue. Yes resources. The object can call resources,
    and apply presence. Lets say, that the brain of the object is chunk of javascript.
    This javascript can think, and if it want or user ask, it can call an other presence
    and separate or update it self.

    tool4e is splitter!

    It is abstract domain host and web content 3D splitter.
    tool4e handles users, spaces, objects, presences, locations management and lot more...
    Those who own specific domain hosted by tool4e, can organyze clouds of smart objects into
    colorful spaces, and to pick up special locations for its visitors.
    Also tool4e provide privacy of the spaces, by powering the users with different permissions.

    This platform is specified for software developers.
    If you want to create your own spaces in your web platform,
    you will have to consult with specialists.
    Good start is to contact me on appostolov@gmail.com

    Thank you for your time!
